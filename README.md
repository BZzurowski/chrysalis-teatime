# chrysalis-teatime

Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd, smiling <BR>
Merciless, the magistrate turns 'round, frowning <BR>
and who's the fool who wears the crown <BR>
Go down in your own way <BR>
And everyday is the right day <BR>
And as you rise above the fear lines in his brown <BR>
You look down <BR>
Hear the sound of the faces in the crowd
