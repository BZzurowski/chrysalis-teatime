Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd, smiling ...
Merciless, the magistrate turns 'round, frowning ...
and who's the fool who wears the crown ...
Go down in your own way ...
And everyday is the right day ...
And as you rise above the fear lines in his brown ...
You look down ...
Hear the sound of the faces in the crowd
